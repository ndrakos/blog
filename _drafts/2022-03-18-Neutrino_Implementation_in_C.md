In this post, I am going to write the code to assign velocity to the particles. I did this in a <a href="https://ndrakos.github.io/blog/cosmo_ics/Neutrino_Velocity_Assignment_Test/">previous post</a> in python, but now I want to write it in a form that will be incorporated into MUSIC, and eventually Cholla.
