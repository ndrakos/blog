In this post I'm going to outline some of the upcoming galaxy surveys that probe the EoR. My main scientific question is how to compare these different surveys. I want to be able to quantify how well different surveys can constrain the EoR.

## JWST Surveys

There is an overview of JWST surveys that will study the EoR in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv211013160R/abstract">Robertson 2021</a>.

## Table of surveys

Here is the list of surveys that I will look at to begin with. For now, I am focusing on the NIRCam parts of the surveys (not MIRI).

## Area versus depth

The main difference/easiest comparison to make between these surveys is area versus depth.

## Other considerations

Area and depth give a general picture of how many detectable galaxies there will be in a survey, and also determine the amount of cosmic variance. This will give a good indication of how well the UV luminosity function can be constrained by different surveys.

But when comparing between telescopes, there are also resolution and wavelength considerations. Different surveys will use different filters. Additionally, spectroscopic surveys will get much more information than photometric surveys (spectral lines, accurate redshifts).

## Key quantities

Really what I want to know are the ability of the survey to constrain
(1) UV luminosity function
(2) xi.. from SEDs?
(3) fesc?
and maybe:
(4) topology
