Bradley has been analyzing a simulation of a tidally stripped two-component model that I had given him. The simulation I had given him was for two Hernquist profiles added together (<a href="https://ndrakos.github.io/blog/tidal_stripping/Two_Component_System/">see this post</a>). Now that he has the methodology for this analysis working, I want to start to think about setting up more realistic initial conditions.

## The model


I am going to model an NFW profile with an embedded King model as in <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02513>Errani et al. 2022</a>. They used...


## Generating inital conditions

## Testing the stability

## Conclusions
