As outlined <a href="https://ndrakos.github.io/blog/cosmo_sims/Rockstar/">here</a>, I had decided to switch to Rockstar for the halo finder.


## 1024 HMF

I ran the rockstar halo finder on the 1024 simulations according to the script earlier... Want to check that the HMF looks okayI updated my code to read in the rockstar formatted outputs, and also handle multiple files.

Here is the plot:

Halo definition different than before???

For comparison, see the first plot in <a href="https://ndrakos.github.io/blog/mocks/HMF_Lightcone/">this post</a>, in which I plot the HMF from the 512 simulation... Can see we are resolving the HMF about a factor of 10 lower than before...

## Next

Next I will run this on the 2048 simulation, and also look into making merger trees (since abundance matching requires peak values).
