As I said in the <a href="https://ndrakos.github.io/blog/tidal_stripping/Two_Component_ICs/">last post</a>, I will set up a "Double Alpha" profile. Here I am checking the stability of the IC code.

## Position Assignment

Here are the initial positions

Looks like this part is working. If the velocities are assigned correctly, this should be stable when evolved in isolation.


## Run in Isolation


## Conclusions


These look stable.

Next steps:
1. Decide a fiducial orbit, calculate the snapshot spacing (so that there are 10 snapshots per orbit)
2. Run the fiducial case for Bradley
3. Decide a grid of simulations
4. Run simulations: See if Peter wants to get involved again, or if Bradley wants to run them. Otherwise I'll do this part.
