In <a href="https://ndrakos.github.io/blog/reion/Reionization_Shell_Model_Part_II/">this previous post</a>, I found that all the galaxies I was testing had declining SFHs:

A possible explanation was that I was using my "test" catalog, which only contains the most massive, brightest systems. If I take the full DREaM catalog, I find:

which shows most of the galaxies actually have rising SFHs! This is encouraging :)
