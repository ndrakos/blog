I outlined the reionization modelling in <a href="https://ndrakos.github.io/blog/reion/Reionization_Modelling/">this post</a>.

Here, I am going to begin to outline my calculation of the IGM ionized fraction in the DREaM catalog.


## Calculation

The volume-filling fraction of ionized gas:

$$ \frac{ dQ_{\rm HII} }{ dt} = \frac{ \dot{n}_{\rm ion} } {\langle n_H \rangle} - \frac{Q}{\bar{t}_{\rm rec}} $$


### Emissivity of Ionizing Photons

$$\dot{n}_{\rm ion}$$ is the co-moving emissivity of ionizing photons. I outlined the calculation for this in previous posts (see <a href="https://ndrakos.github.io/blog/reion/Production_of_Ionizing_Photons_Part_II/">here</a>). This is what I am using for the "fiducial" reionization model. I will also explore other variations in the future.

Here is a plot, where I have added on measurements from the Lyman alpha forest:

Our model agrees well with Naidu 2020 and Yung 2020, including the disagreement with the Ly$$\alpha$$ forest constraints. I will try and plot other models on top of ours at some point (I'll see if their data is tabulated, or if I have to read it off the plot somehow).

I need to read up a bit on the Ly$$\alpha$$ forest constraints; how exactly they are obtained and why the Becker measurements disagree with the Kuhlen measurements. I think Yung 2020 shows you can reconcile things with a different $$f_{\rm esc}$$ model.

### Density of Hydrogen

The volume-averaged co-moving density of intergalactic hydrogen is given by:

$$ \langle n_H \rangle = X \Omega_b \rho_c/m_{H}$$

$$\Lambda$$CDM parameters:
- $$X=0.75$$: the primordial mass-fraction of hydrogen (note this is what Yung+2020 uses. Naidu+2020 uses 0.75328, but I'm not quite sure where this is from.)
- $$\Omega_b=0.04893$$: baryon density
- $$\rho_c = 3 H_0^2/8\pi G = 2.7754 \times 10^{11} h^2 M_\odot {\rm Mpc}^{-3}$$: critical density
- $$m_H$$: mass of a hydrogen atom

I calculated $$\langle n_H \rangle =1.9\times 10^{-7} cm^{-3}$$, which is identical to what is found in Madau & Dickinson 2014.

### Hydrogen Recombination Time

The recombination time of ionized hydrogen in the IGM is given by:

$$t_{\rm rec} = [ C_{\rm HII} \alpha_B (1 + (1-X)/4X)  \langle n_H \rangle  (1+z)^3 ]^{-1}$$


The clumping factor, $$C_{\rm HII} = \langle n_H^2 \rangle/ \langle n_H \rangle^2$$ is the redshift-dependent HII clumping factor that models the inhomgeneity of the IGM.

- Naidu2020 sets this to 3
- Finkelstein2019 and Yung2020 use numerical predictions from the radiation-hydrodynamical simulation by <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.451.1586P/abstract">Pawlik et al. (2015)</a>. In this, $$C_{\rm HII}$$ evolves from 1.5 to 4.8 between z=14 and 6.

I will start by using just a constant value (e.g. 3) to get this working, but I want to implement the Pawlik model, and see how much this changes things.


$$\alpha_B$$ is the the temperature-dependent case B recombination coefficient for hydrogen

- Naidu2020 states $$\alpha_B 2.6 \times 10^{-13} (T/10^4 {\rm K})^{0.76} {\rm cm^3 s^{-1}}$$ uses $$T=10^4$$ (They cite Shull et al. 2012; Robertson et al. 2013, 2015; Pawlik et al. 2015; Sun & Furlanetto 2016). It looks like they are taking this directly from Sun & Furlanetto 2016.
- Finkelstein2019 and Yung2020  cite Hui & Gnedin (1997) and use $$T=2 \times 10^4$$ (Finkelstein cites Robertson 2015).
- Shell+2012 say $$\alpha_B 2.59 \times 10^{-13} (T/10^4 {\rm K})^{-0.845} {\rm cm^3 s^{-1}}$$ and cite  (Osterbrock
& Ferland 2006). They state "for typical IGM ionization histories and photoelectric heating rates, numerical simulations predict that diffuse photoionized filaments of hydrogen have temperatures ranging from 5000 K to 20,000 K (Dav√© et al. 2001; Smith et al. 2011)"

Given all this, I will probably use the Naidu model, but I need to double check why the exponent is different in the Shell paper versus the Naidu paper.
