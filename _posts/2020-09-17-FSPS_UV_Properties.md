We want to match the FSPS SEDs to galaxies based on their UV magnitude and UV continuum slope (see <a href="https://ndrakos.github.io/blog/mocks/FSPS/">this post</a> for an overview). I will refer to these values as the "target parameters"

In <a href="https://ndrakos.github.io/blog/mocks/FSPS_Parameters/">this post</a>, I outlined some of the potential free parameters in FSPS.


## Fixed Parameters

Some of the "free" parameters will actually be fixed

<code>zred</code> -- redshift of galaxy

<code>tage</code> -- age of the galaxy (Gyr), in terms of cosmic time. This can be set to the age of the universe at redshift <code>zred</code>

<code>gas_logz</code> -- I will set this to be the same as the metallicity <code>logzsol</code>

<code>sf_trunc</code>  -- This is the time at which star formation turns off. I might play around with this for quiescent galaxies, but for now I am only considering star-forming, so I will leave this to 0.0 (which assumes that star formation is ongoing).

## Fixed Parameters


However, the following parameters will be explored:

<code>logzsol</code> -- the metallicity. Williams et al. used a range of [-2.2,0.24].

<code>sf_start</code> -- start time of SFH, in Gyr. A reasonable range for this is between 30 Myr and <code>tage</code>.

<code>tau</code> -- this is the e-folding time in Gyr for star formation; the delayed tau model defined the star formation history as $$\psi(t) \propto t \exp (-t/\tau)$$.
FSPS allows values for  <code>tau</code> to be in the range [0.1,1e2]. Williams et al. asserts that the maximum allowed should be  $$\log_{10} \tau_{\rm max} = 10^{1.11 \log(sf_{start})-2.02}$$ (in units of years), to ensure reasonable sSFRs.


<code>dust2</code> -- dust attenuation, in units of $$\log_{10} (yrs)$$. Williams uses a range range of [0,4] for $$\hat{\tau}_V$$; I am going to use this for now, but I need to check whether these dust parameters are defined the same.

<code>gas_logu</code> -- gas ionization parameter. Williams et al. uses a range of [-4,-2].



## Creating SED

I'm going to consider a galaxy of mass $$10^8 M_\odot$$ at redshift zero. The age of the universe should be about 13.8 Gyr, which sets <code>tage</code>=13.8

For the potential free parameters, I assign them baseline values of <code>logzsol</code>=0, <code>sf_start</code>=10, <code>tau</code> = 1, <code>dust2</code>=0, <code>gas_logz</code>=-2


Here is the code for creating an sps object with my current parameters
```
sps = fsps.StellarPopulation(zcontinuous=1)

myzred = 0 #redshift
mymass = 1e8 #stellar mass

mylogzsol = 0 #metallicity [-2.2,0.24]; Williams
mytau = 1 #efolding time of star formation (Gyr)
mysf_start = 10 #start of SFH (Gyr)... has to be less than tage
mydust2 = 0 #dust attenuation [0,4]?
mygas_logu = -2 #gas ionization [-4,-2]; Williams

mysf_trunc = 0 #end of SFH (Gyr)... 0 means no truncation
mygas_logz = mylogzsol # gas metallicity
mytage = 13.8 #age of galaxy in Gyr

sps.params['imf_type']=1
sps.params['sfh']=4
sps.params['dust_type']=2
sps.params['add_neb_emission']=True
sps.params['dust1']=0

sps.params['zred']=myzred
sps.params['tage']=mytage
sps.params['logzsol']=mylogzsol
sps.params['tau']=mytau
sps.params['sf_start']=mysf_start
sps.params['sf_trunc']=mysf_trunc
sps.params['dust2']=mydust2
sps.params['gas_logu']=mygas_logu
sps.params['gas_logz']=mygas_logz
```




FSPS normalizes the star formation history by one stellar mass. The final galaxy mass is stored in the variable <code>sps.stellar_mass</code>. Therefore I scaled the SED luminosity by $$M_{\rm gal}/$$<code>sps.stellar_mass</code>. Note that I am currently including the mass from stellar remnants in  <code>sps.stellar_mass</code>. I can turn this off with a flag. I need to think about how the stellar mass functions I used for abundance matching are defined, and whether this should be included.

Additionally, the output of FSPS is in units of $$L_\odot/Hz$$. If we consider the object to be 10 parsecs away, we can divide this by $$4 \pi (10 {\rm pc})^2 $$ to get a flux density, corresponding to the absolute magnitude.


Here is the SED for this example:

## Target Parameters




### UV Magnitude

I used the definition of $$M_{UV}$$ from <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJ...768...71R/abstract">Robertson et al 2013</a>:  this is the average magnitude at rest-frame wavelength in a flat filter, in range $$1450-1550$$ Angstroms.

I calculated the average flux density between the corresponding frequencies ($$\nu_1$$ and $$\nu_2$$) as:

$$\langle f_\nu \rangle =  \dfrac{\int_{\nu_1}^{\nu_2} f_{\nu}d\nu}{\nu_2-\nu_1} $$

Then, the AB magnitude can be calculated from this.


### UV Continuum Slope

The UV continuum slope can be measured from the spectrum $$f_\lambda \propto \lambda^{\beta}$$. Using eq 2 from <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.420..901D/abstract">Dunlop et al 2012</a>, you can measure $$\beta$$ as:

$$\beta = 3.91(Y098-J125)-2$$

I calculated the magnitudes in these filters using the builtin magnitude function in FSPS; I used the included 'wfc3_ir_f098m' and 'wfc3_ir_f125w' filters.


## Conclusions

With the parameters above, I get a magnitude of $$M_{\rm UV}=-14.09$$ and $$\beta=-1.9$$.

These numbers seem reasonable. The next step is to vary the free parameters and see how they influence the target parameters. This will guide how I decide to do the spectrum fitting.
