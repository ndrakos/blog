We had decided to use FSPS to create SEDs, as outlined <a href="https://ndrakos.github.io/blog/mocks/FSPS_UV_Properties/">here</a>. We also identified five potential free parameters, and how they affect the UV properties we are trying to match <a href="https://ndrakos.github.io/blog/mocks/FSPS_Free_Parameters/">here</a>

In this post, I will outline a quick way of assigning SEDs based on mean relations. We will likely improve this later, to account for scatter in the relations.



## Gas Ionization Parameter

The gas ionization parameter, $$U_S$$ (<code>gas_logu</code>), does not seem to affect the UV properties much. We can use the relation from <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.468.2140C/abstract">Carton et al. 2017</a> to relate the metallicity, $$Z$$ and $$U_S$$. (This relation is for low redshift only, but we will neglect that for now).

$$\log_{10} U_S = -0.8 \log_{10}(Z/Z_{\odot})-3.58$$



## Star Formation History


Before, we identified <code>logzol</code>,<code>tau</code>,<code>sf_start</code>,<code>dust2</code> and <code>gas_logu</code> to be the parameters we wanted to control.


The parameters <code>tau</code> and <code>sf_start</code> control the SFH. It is probabliy more natural to talk in terms of the star formation history, $$\psi$$ and the age of the galaxy, $$a=$$<code>t_age</code> - <code>sf_start</code>.

We have chosen to describe the SFR by a delayed tau model:

$$\psi(t) \propto t e^{-t/\tau}$$

FSPS normalizes this so that one solar mass of stars is created over the age of the universe. The time, $$t$$,  ranges between <code>sf_start</code> and <code>t_age</code> and $$\tau$$ is the star formation rate (<code>tau</code>).

The normalization constant can be calculated as $$C = M_{\rm gal}/$$<code>stellar_mass</code>, and $$\psi$$ is then:

$$\psi = C a e^{-a/\tau}$$

To describe the SFR, we will use the fundamental metallicity relation $$M_*$$--$$Z$$--$$\psi$$ (Eq 15 in Williams, but see also <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.463.2020H/abstract">Hunt et al. 2016</a>):


$$\log{Z_{\rm ISM}/Z_\odot} + 8.7 \approx -0.14 \log(\psi/M_{\odot}{\rm yr}^{-1}) + 0.37 \log(M/M_{\rm odot})+4.82$$


Therefore, you can express $$\psi$$ in terms of the metallicity and galaxy mass.



## Dust

The dust attenuation can be calculated from the $$\psi$$--$$Z$$--$$\hat{\tau}_{V}$$. To do this, Williams et al. follows <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999A%26A...350..381D/abstract">Devriendt et al 1999</a>.

First, you can calculate  the $$V$$ band, face-on attenuation optical depth:

$$\hat{\tau}_{V} =\left(\frac{Z_{\mathrm{ISM}}}{Z_{\odot}}\right)^{1.6}\left(\frac{N_{\mathrm{H}}}{2.1 \times 10^{21} \mathrm{cm}^{-2}}\right)$$


The mean hydrogen column density can be determined from the cold gas fraction:

$$N_H = 6.8 \times 10^{21} \dfrac{M_{\rm gas}}{M_* + M_{\rm gas}}$$

To calculate $$M_{\rm gas}$$ you can use $$M_{\rm gas}=\Sigma_{\rm gas} \pi r^2$$, and then relate $$\Sigma_{\rm gas}$$ to $$\Sigma_{\rm \psi} = \psi/(\pi r^2)$$ using the Kennicutt-Shmidt relation.
I haven't assigned galaxy sizes yet, so for now I am just going to assume that $$M_{gas}=10^9 \psi$$. My reasoning is that about 10% of the gas should be converted to stars every $$10^8$$ years.


You can then convert this face-on attenuation to the average galaxy dust attenuation averaged over inclination angles (equation 21 in Williams). For now I am just using this averaged attenuation parameter.



## The Final Two Parameters

Now we have two free parameters, metallicity and galaxy age that we want to use to fit $$M_{UV}$$ and $$\beta$$.

If we explore this in parameter space:

Note that the white regions are where the star formation time, $$\tau$$ was too low to be feasible. Overall we have two parameters and two unknowns; this could be used to fit the metallicity and galaxy age using a local minima solver.

## Next Steps

I now have a rough method for assigning SEDs.

1) The method outlined in this post is for star-forming galaxies. I will need to also assign to quiescent galaxies. The procedure from Williams et al. is given in Section 4.2. They chose age, star formation timescale and metallicities from uniform distributions. <code>gas_logu</code> does not need to ne assigned. In Williams et al. they also neglected dist attenuation---I will copy this for now, but I am not sure how reasonable this is.

2) How long does this take to assign SEDs to each galaxy? Will I need to speed it up? (Might be better to do a grid and interpolate along it...)

3) If I try and recover all these relations from the mock catalog, do they look reasonable? How is the scatter? Will this be accurate enough for our purposes?

4) Given the SEDs, I need to recover the magnitude in the different bands. For now, I'll just use some built-in filters to get it working, but I should get the proper filter information from Brant.
