Here are my notes about switching to the 1024 simulations.


## Simulation

I ran 1024 simulations a while ago and checked their output was okay, as documented <a href="https://ndrakos.github.io/blog/cosmo_sims/1024_Sims_Catalogs/">here</a>


## Halo Finder

Additionally, I ran Rockstar and checked that the HMF looked okay <a href="https://ndrakos.github.io/blog/cosmo_sims/Rockstar_Part_II/">here</a>

## Merger Trees

I also ran consistent-trees on the snapshots. This was significantly slower at this resolution. I have been running on lou, since that's where I have all the outputs stored. However, lou only allows you to run a job for 3 days, and you can only use 1 node at a time (with 24 cores).

Therefore, I needed to look into how to restart jobs that didn't finish, and also how to run on multiple cores.


### Restarting trees


Both the <code>gravitational_consistency</code> and  <code>find_parents_and_cleanup</code> programs accept an extra command line argument which is the snap number at which the code should resume processing. The information on where the code died can be found in  <code>timing.log</code>.

Therefore, I edited the file in <code>consistent-trees/do_merger_tree.pl</code> to take extra command line argument, as follows:

```
#!/usr/bin/perl -w                                                                               

my $cfg = $ARGV[0];
my $restart = $ARGV[1];
check_system("./gravitational_consistency", $cfg, $restart);
check_system("./find_parents_and_cleanup", $cfg);
check_system("./resort_outputs", $cfg);
check_system("./assemble_halo_trees", $cfg);

sub check_system {
    system(@_) == 0 or
        die "Tree creation failed while executing \"@_\".\n(See errors above).\n";
}
```

### Parallelization

The code automatically uses OpenMP if available. here was my job script (note I commented out the first line after it finished running... in this example I had restarted the second step at snapshot 337):


```
#PBS -l select=1:ncpus=4:ompthreads=4:mem=100MB
#PBS -l walltime=72:00:00
#PBS -q ldan

module load mpi-sgi/mpt
module load comp-intel/2018.3.222
module load python3/3.7.0

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/nasa/pkgsrc/sles12/2016Q4/lib:/pleiades/u/ndrakos/ins\
tall_to_here/gsl_in/lib

cd /pleiades/u/ndrakos/consistent-trees

#perl /pleiades/u/ndrakos/Rockstar/scripts/gen_merger_cfg.pl /u/ndrakos/wfirst1024/HaloFinder/ro\
ckstar_param.cfg
perl do_merger_tree.pl /u/ndrakos/wfirst1024/HaloFinder/outputs/merger_tree.cfg 337
perl halo_trees_to_catalog.pl /u/ndrakos/wfirst1024/HaloFinder/outputs/merger_tree.cfg
```



## Light Cone

I am now running the light cone on the 1024 simulations. I now have this setup to run on the NASA computers (previously I was running it on my laptop).

I altered the code so that it is parallelized---every tiled box can be run separately. Therefore, I can run on up to 60 cores to get the maximum amount of speedup. I could potentially parallelize this even more, but since I am currently running on lou, I am limited to 24 cores anyway.
